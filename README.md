Distributed Robust Set-Invariance of Interconnected Linear Systems

    We introduce a class of distributed control policies for networks of discrete-time linear systems with polytopic additive disturbances. The objective is to restrict the network-level state and controls  to user-specified polyhedral sets for all times. This problem arises in many safety-critical applications. We consider two problems. First, given a communication graph characterizing the structure of the information flow in the network, we find the optimal distributed control policy by solving a single linear program. Second, we find the sparsest communication graph required for the existence of a distributed invariance-inducing control policy. Illustrative examples, including one on platooning, are presented.
